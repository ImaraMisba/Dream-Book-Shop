Python CLI Dataset Analysis System using SOLID Design Principles

This project introduces a Python-based Command line interface data analysis system designed for Dream book shop to facilitate the examination and interpretation of a historical book dataset. The application has been developed by using object-oriented programming principles and adhering to SOLID design principles to enhance clarity, maintainability and scalability. Every analytical function, encompassing publication trend over time, identification of the five most top authors, language distribution analysis, publisher analysis, missing ISBN evaluation and yearly publication analysis by language, is implemented as an individual module utilizing the strategy design pattern. The system uses Pandas library to facilitate efficient data processing and Matplotlib to generate clear visual representations. Application interaction is enabled through a secure, menu-driven interface, thereby assuring user friendliness while maintaining a professional and structured methodology for data analysis.
